# Ford-Case
In response to evolving environmental and demographic shifts in the European market, Ford embarked on developing the compact Ford Ka. This initiative aimed to cater to the increasing demand for smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles. The market research conducted encompassed both demographic and psychographic data to effectively segment and target potential customers for the Ford Ka. Through predictive and exploratory analyses, insights were gleaned to optimize market strategies and identify the target demographic for the new product.

The project comprises an R file containing the code used for the analysis and a detailed report elucidating the results obtained. The R file facilitates the replication and further exploration of the analysis conducted, while the report provides a comprehensive understanding of the findings and their implications.
